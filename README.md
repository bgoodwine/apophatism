Hey man,

I’ve been trying to hack into the Via Negationis Intranet for weeks now, ever since 
I found out they’re the elite hacker group lead by The One. I finally found a backdoor 
into their server: https://bgoodwine.github.io/apophatism/. I’m pretty sure The One is 
active on this server, so if we just poke around a bit, we can contact him. So click 
the link and read my message, I’m waiting for you!

My multimedia project is a video game where the player is trying to learn more about the leader of the world’s most elite hacker group, “The One” (a thinly veiled metaphor for God). The player hacks into Saints’ accounts, reads their emails, and runs programs that show excerpts and interpretations of different apophatic texts, all in an attempt to reach the part of the dark web where The One resides.

This game was built off of a fork of the [email reader terminal emulator game](https://github.com/jacksonbenete/email_terminal) by Jackson Benete. It includes exerpts from and reinterpretations of Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross, Mystical Theology by Pseudo Dionysius, and The Life of Moses by St. Gregory of Nyssa.
